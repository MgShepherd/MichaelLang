# MGS Lang

A small programming language compiler implemented in C (language name still to be confirmed).

Note: This language is still in very early development and so a lot of the features mentioned
in this document have either not been implemented at all yet or are still being worked on.

This is a hobby project worked on by a solo developer, so progress may be slow and gradual,
but I do aim to deliver on the ideas I have outlined.

## Language

The MGS Language (to be confirmed) is a low level, statically typed language with a focus
on ease of maintenance and high level of control for the developer.

This is achieved through explictness wherever possible, potentially adding a bit of time
to the initial development process, but making long term maintainance of projects much simpler.

We also have a focus on large support for testing at all levels, aiming to encourage better test
coverage throughout our projects by making the tests simple to write and maintain

### Language Features (Future)

Here are a few of the main features I am aiming to implement in the language (this is not an 
exhaustive list and is subject to change):

- Manual memory management and ability to define custom allocators
- No fixed build system
- Explicit error handling through error function annotations
- Everything is constant by default
- No null values everywhere - only when explicitly defined can null values be used
- Duck-typing interfaces 
- First class support for testing - table testing, benchmarking, fuzzing etc.

## Building the Project

As there are currently no releases of the compiler, the project must be built directly from source.

### Dependencies

This project currently uses LLVM as a compiler backend and uses clang to convert the object file into
a native executable.

As a result, to build the compiler from source both LLVM and Clang must be installed on the system.

### Building

Assuming all the dependencies are installed, simply run:
```
make
```
This will create the compiler executable as `./build/Compiler` which can then be run.

If you instead want to build and run the project in a single command, you can instead run:
```
make run
```

## Running the Tests

The compiler comes with a series of unit tests to ensure that compilation is working as expected.

As there is no standardised unit testing framework in C, we use a combination of hand written 
comparisons as well as `assert.h` (for a good example of this, refer to `tests/lexer_tests.c`)

To build and run all the tests, use:
```
make test
```
Unfortunately, due to the custom nature of the testing setup, there is currently no way to run
individual tests, but this is something which may be added in the future.

## AI Usage

All the code in this project is handwritten. AI has only been used for code review and general 
querying, but never for actually making changes within the project.

The main rationale behind this is purely that I enjoy writing code and since this is a hobby project,
I see no reason to get AI to write all the code for me. I have no plans to make AI start
writing any code within this project.
